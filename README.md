# Color Identification Using Machine Learning

Problem Statement: Using ML to identify RGB Values of images from an image that have that color in them.

Project Description: I will use python an its different libraries to identify colors in an image and will generate a graph of the same to represent the RGB Values of Colors to identify images from a collection that have that color in them.

I have used machine learning algorithm, KMeans, to extract colors from a given image. I have used OpenCV2 for image manipulation, apply KMeans to identify the major colors and then plotted the information using Matplotlib. I used sklearn for KMeans algorithm, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs, numpy to work with arrays, cv2 to work with image data, collections to use Counter to count values, rgb2lab to convert RGB values and deltaE_cie76 to calculate similarity between colors.
